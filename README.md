# Language server for PSS

Welcome to the **PSS Language Server** project, a dedicated backend service for providing robust language support for **Accellera's Portable Stimulus Standard (PSS)** across any IDE that supports the LSP protocol.

## ðŸš€ Features (Planned and In Progress)

- **Syntax Analysis:** Fast and accurate parsing for PSS source files.
- **Code Completion:** Intelligent suggestions for PSS keywords, types, functions, and user-defined elements.
- **Signature Help:** Display function signatures with parameter descriptions.
- **Diagnostics:** Inline error detection and syntax validation.
- **Hover Documentation:** Detailed tooltips for PSS constructs.
- **Embedded Code Support:** Parsing and diagnostics for embedded C and SystemVerilog code.

## ðŸ”§ Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thisisthedarshan/pss-langserver.git
   cd pss-langserver
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Start the language server in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## ðŸ“‘ Usage in IDEs

To use the PSS LSP in any IDE that supports LSP:

1. Ensure the IDE is configured to recognize external language servers.
2. Provide the path to the `pss-lsp` binary installed globally by npm.
3. Verify that the IDE communicates using standard LSP communication protocols (like `stdio` ).
